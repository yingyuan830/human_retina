# 08. cross species analysis

- We performed the integration based on the list of one-to-one orthologous genes across human and mouse via Seurat. We identified orthologous sequences for the human cis-regulatory region in mice using liftOver. We also performed differential expression analysis on pseudo bulk count profiles for each cell type using edgeR.
